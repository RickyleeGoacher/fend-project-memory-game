# Memory Game Project

Udacity FEND Memory Game Project | Made with vanilla JavaScript

## Future updates

Due to falling slightly behind on the udacity FEND course updates will be postponed for a short while :)

* Adding a better timer and having it intergrated into the score system.
* Attempting to build my own shuffle function.


### How to play

* When the game loads the timer will start.
* Click the tiles to turn them over. Make sure to remember the currency you saw.
* Flip another card, if it matched, the cards will stay on screen. 
* If the cards don't match, they will both turn back over.
* Repeat untill all the cards are matched.

## Options to play

* Download or clone the game from the Github repository and load index.html in tour browser.

## The Instructions i recieved for the project

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
