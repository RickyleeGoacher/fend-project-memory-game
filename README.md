# Memory Game Project

Udacity FEND Memory Game Project | Made with vanilla JavaScript

## Future updates

Due to falling slightly behind on the udacity FEND course updates will be postponed for a short while :)

* Adding a better timer and having it intergrated into the score system.
* Attempting to build my own shuffle function.


### How to play

* When the game loads the timer will start.
* Click the tiles to turn them over. Make sure to remember the currency you saw.
* Flip another card, if it matched, the cards will stay on screen. 
* If the cards don't match, they will both turn back over.
* Repeat untill all the cards are matched.

## Options to play

* Download or clone the game from the Github repository and load index.html in tour browser.
* Click this [Udacity currency memory game](https://rickyleegoacher.github.io./) and play the live version.

There is three possible star ratings you can achieve based on how many moves it takes you to complete the game.

* Easy - 22 Moves 
* Medium - 16 Moves
* Hard - 12 Moves

## Features

* Timer - The timer will start when the game begins and you will be given your time at the end of the game.
* Move counter - Displays the current number of moves you have made.
* Star rating - Dynamically displays your current star rating, starting at three stars and dropping to zero as you make your moves.
* Restart button - Made a mistake? don't worry, click the reset button to start the game fresh.

## The Instructions i recieved for the project

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
